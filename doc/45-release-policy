Release policy and numbering
==============================

Starting with 1.0.4, the release policy will be :

<major version>.<minor version>.<release>[patch]

Example : 1.0.4c or 1.0.2

- Major version : No policy for now
- Minor version : Will change after major changes
- Release : Will increase with updates and bug correction. An EVEN number is a stable version, an ODD number is the current dev version
- Patch : in case of bug in stable (even number) release, will be a letter.

The master branch should always be working as build testing is done on every commit, but it is not extensively tested as a release.

Ongoing dev in master branch will always be with an odd release version.
